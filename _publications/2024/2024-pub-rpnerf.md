    In the era of ubiquitous short-video sharing, an overlooked yet significant privacy risk has arisen, the accidental disclosure of confidential information through reflective surfaces, such as mirrors, glass, or even polished metal. Such reflections can inadvertently disclose sensitive personal details to a broad audience without the awareness of content creators. Our examination of 100 top-rated TikTok short videos reveals that, on average, 37.2% of frames in each video feature identifiable reflective surfaces, posing potential privacy risks. In this work, we introduce a framework designed to scrutinize reflective privacy risks in glass-laden short videos. At the heart of the framework is the development of a reflection-specific neural radiance field, termed RP-NeRF, which enables reflection-aware ray tracing for precise extraction and reconstruction of the reflective scenes from the surfaces they appear on. A detailed field study on the framework indicates that the precision in detecting human presence and recognizing objects from the reconstructed reflective images reaches as high as 90.8% and 89.55%, respectively, even when dealing with a reflective surface that boasts 90% transparency and a mere 4% reflectance rate. These findings highlight the urgent need for greater awareness and advanced solutions to safeguard privacy in our digitalage, especially in light of the significant impact of short-video sharing.
