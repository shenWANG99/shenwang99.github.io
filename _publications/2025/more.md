    Accurately modeling the radiance field of 5G signals in urban environments is essential for reliable network operation and scalable planning of next-generation wireless systems. Recent advances in neural radiance fields NeRF^2 have shown great success in capturing the spatially continuous behavior of radio propagation. However, existing NeRF^2 frameworks remain limited to small-scale scenes, suffering from severe accuracy degradation and prohibitive computational costs when extended to city-scale deployments. In this work, we present Mixture of Radio Experts (MoRE), a mixture-of-experts architecture designed for city-scale 5G radiance field reconstruction.
