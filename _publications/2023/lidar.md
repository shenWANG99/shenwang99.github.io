abstract: >-
    Older adults want to remain independent with dignity for as
long as possible. Gait assessment service plays an essential role in elderly
care and rehabilitation by evaluating gait impairment, to provide suitable
and continuous treatments. Despite over a decade of research and development in gait assessment, accurate and reliable gait assessment service
for older adults in use are few. We propose an automatic gait impairment
assessment service, for community-dwelling older adults, by combining
multiple LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensing with 11-meter
walking test. Multiple sensors fusion strategy is employed to sense and
interpret gaits in a complementary way. Leveraging scan-matching technology and foot tracking method, the gait assessment service can achieve
high accuracy with reasonable cost and no privacy issue. The experiment
results show obvious differences of disease-specific motor symptoms in
comparing groups. The potential merit of gait assessment service in daily
use is also explored in this study..
